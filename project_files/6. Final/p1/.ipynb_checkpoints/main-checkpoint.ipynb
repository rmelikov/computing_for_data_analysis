It exercises your understanding of the singular value decomposition (SVD), Numpy, and some basic Python string manipulation. It is worth ten (10) points in total. While the exercises build on one another conceptually, we have precomputed solutions you'll need in each instance so that you can complete them in any order, similar to the Midterm 2 problems.\n",

The clean copy will retain your code but remove any generated output. **However**, it will also **rename** the notebook to `clean.xxx.ipynb`.
