## Folder Infomation

This repository contains all of the class materials for **Georgia Tech's Spring 2020 CSE 6040, Computing for Data Analysis class with Dr. Richard Vuduc**. (As a side note, this was the best class I ever took.) All of the content is in the `project_files` folder and it is sequenced for easier navigation. Inside of the `project_files`, you will find the `Getting Started` folder. So, start there. 

This class is based on Python 3.7 and Jupyter notebooks. I've included the virtual environment that you can use with it. However, you might need to install the needed packages every so often as you run into them throughout the course. I created the virtual environment after the fact.

You can ignore the `Scratch Pad` folder. You don't have to look at it, but you might find some interesting code there and hence why I kept it in there because I want to find that code myself if I'll be looking for it.

Something else to note: some datasets are larger than 100 MB and they have to be stored in LFS (Github's Large File Storage). You will get them if you'll download the whole thing.
